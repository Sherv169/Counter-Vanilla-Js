Recite Me Code Task

After receiving the challenge at 7 oclock on saturday night, i spent some time reading & wrapping my head around the question, trying to think of potential solutions. I spent Sunday refreshing my knowledge about JS Dom manipulation & began coding at around 9 on Monday. This task was thoroughly enjoyable & challenging. This is the type of focused learning i've been longing for! I hope your happy with the result. I'd be honoured to meet with you & then hopefully join the team! :D 


Thanks for the opportunity I appreciate it! :)
